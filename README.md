# angle_of_attack_sensor
Documentation regarding my bachelorsthesis on a 5-hole-probe. 
The goal is to engineer a 5 hole probe for gliders that is capable of giving live angle of attack data to the flightcomputer. 
The Bachelor thesis contains the construction of two seperate probes. 
One big probe which is optimized for research fligths on the G109 of the institue of aerodynamics and fluid dynamics. 
One smal probe which is optimized for the easy installation on gliders.
